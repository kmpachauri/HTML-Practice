    <h2>History : </h2>
    <div id="A">
        Lord Hanuman is the one of the bravest and most powerful characters in the epic Ramayana. Stories of his courageous feats abound 
        in Hindu mythology, whether it be the time when he lifted a whole mountain to bring the Sanjeevani booti for Laxman, or when he 
        flew over the ocean all the way to Sri Lanka to convey to Sita Rama’s message. 
    </div>

<br> 

    <div id="B">
        The name ‘bajrang’ is derived from the word ‘vajra’ which was Indra’s weapon, and stands for thunder and lightning, and the word
        “ang” (limbs). Interestingly, Indra had struck down Hanuman with his vajra when he as a child had tried to devour the sun mistaking
        it to be a fruit. So, “bajrang” came to refer to the one with limbs as strong as thunder and lightning. The word “bali”, of course,
        refers to his immense bodily strength. 
    </div>

</br>

    <div id="C">
        When  Indra, fearing that the earth might be deprived of the sun, struck down Hanuman with his vajra, his jaw got permanently
        disfigured and discoloured. Hence the coinage “hanu” which means cheek or jaw, and ‘man’ which means ‘prominent’ or ‘disfigured’.
